M:
	-M1 starts selection model

p:
	-p X gives prob_mut_beneficial value X

P: 
	-P X gives prob_mut_BG value X

q: 
	-q X gives prob_mut_divergent value X


-In order to get cumulative site type probabilities to not exceed 1, prob_mut_beneficial cannot exceed 0.3333 due to additive nature of program setup.
	If i want prob_mut_BG or prob_mut_divergent to have values of 0 for debugging purposes, would it screw things up to make them negative?

From Reproduction move 
    selectionCoefficients = (double *) malloc( (sizeof(double)*totalSitesInGenome));
to buildFitnessArray;
causing segfault?

(Didn't fix it!)

There's another variable called alleleSelectionCoeffs.

Ask about line 435. dpt2 uses alleleSelectionCoeffs; know how this works before you remove it!!!!!!!


-----------------------------------------------------


Line 1275, viabilitySelection


if (*sipt == 1){
-Assume that alleles with 0 are not under selection?? 

Change numAlive to global variable to allow for passing between functions?? Are there disadvantages to this approach?

-------------------------------------------------


Within buildFitnessArray:

siteTypeProbabilities[3] has no data assigned because PROB_MUT_BENEFICIAL_DEFAULT = 0. All the rest of the mutation probabilities are 0 as well
